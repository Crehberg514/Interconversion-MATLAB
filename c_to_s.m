function [S0, SMats, lambdas] = c_to_s(C0, CMats, rhos)
    % Convert a prony series relaxation modulus to creep compliance.
    %
    % MATLAB numerical implementation of algorithm 3 from "Interconversion of
    % linearly viscoelastic material functions expressed as Prony series"[1].
    % Requiring the equilibrium relaxation modulus, the relaxation coefficient
    % modulus matrices, the inverted time series, and finally the size of the
    % square matrices.
    %
    % This version is of the algorithm is not limited to 6 by 6 matrices, but
    % has been minimally adjusted to accept any square matrices.
    %
    % Parameters
    %----------
    % C0 : 2D matrix
    %     The equilibrium relaxation modulus as a 2D square array.
    % CMats : 3D matrix
    %     The relaxation modulus coefficients as a 3D array, with the third
    %     dimension being the coefficient matrices and the first and second
    %     being the row and columns respectfully.
    % rhos : Vector
    %     Relaxation time constants
    %
    % Returns
    % -------
    % S0 : 2D matrix
    %     The instantaneous creep modulus returned as a 2D square array.
    % SMats : 3D matrix
    %     The creep modulus coefficient returned as a 3D array, with the third
    %     dimension being the coefficient matrices and the first and second
    %     being the row and columns respectfully.
    % lambdas : Vector
    %     The inverted creep time constants in a 1D array.
